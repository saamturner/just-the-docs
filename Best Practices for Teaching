Before the Lesson
Discuss the artifact before your students begin annotation, so students will have a clear sense of what to observe and annotate in the recording.
Direct students to make a Github account before the workshop. 
Tell students to bring headphones to class if the recording to be annotated contains sound.
Have a clear learning objective for using AVAnnotate: this might be situating your analysis, transcription or observations in the time of the recording, employing film vocabulary, or analyzing interview techniques for oral histories.
Give students as much information in advance as possible, such as the direct link to the recording file or a pre-existing IIIF manifest if the artifact has one, the layers to be used, a short example project, a raw annotation spreadsheet, and a link to the How to Use page including our annotation template.
Decide whether the AVAnnotate project will be a formative or summative assignment. If it is formative, you may want to accept completed annotation spreadsheets if students fail to complete a project in the time allotted. If it is summative, you should give students ample time to not only complete annotations, but perfect their final project.
Remember: the more freedom students are given in designing their annotation projects, the more they will need to understand the organizing elements of AVAnnotate: layers, index, the definition of an annotation etc. This will help students decide for themselves how to maximize the layout of AVAnnotate to best present the annotations. Please consult the Annotation Guide and the FAQ page in order to fluently define these terms for your students. For a short assignment, you may want to assign specific layers to be used in the assignment (see the example assignment below).
